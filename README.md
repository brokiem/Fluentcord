<br/>
Fluentcord is an alternative Discord client for Windows, Linux, and Mac, designed with a focus on resource efficiency and performance.
<br/><br/>
Unlike many other Discord clients that use Electron, Fluentcord is written in C#, ensuring that it consumes fewer system
resources while still offering most of Discord's features. While Fluentcord is still in development, it already provides a
rich set of functionalities and includes support for voice communication.
